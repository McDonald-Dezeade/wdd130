    <p>I'm a citizen of the Republic of Liberia. Monrovia, the capital of the Republic of Liberia, is where I live. I'm 23 years of age. Technology inspires me a lot. And as a result I'm determined to help bring to pass its blessings. I love lots of things. But I'm much confortable with reading and learning new things.</p>
